// Here, my prompt was to solve the (easy) first problem of the Project Euler series (https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
// Notably, despite if/else statements featuring in the code prompts used for training, ChatGPT gets the syntax wrong here
// It also uses 'for' loops instead of recursion, despite SIL being a functional language
